# 1. Data Collection 
- Gathered carbon emission datasets from publicly available sources, including:  
  - Government environmental agencies.  
  - Research papers on carbon footprint analysis.  
  - Online carbon footprint calculators and emission factor databases.  
- Collected user input data (e.g., transportation mode, electricity consumption, diet, and shopping habits) for personalized analysis.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

# A. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
- Removed **missing values** and handled **data inconsistencies**.  
- Standardized units (e.g., converting fuel consumption into **kg COâ‚‚ emissions**).  
- Categorized emissions into **five key sectors**:  
  âœ… Transport
  âœ… Energy Consumption  
  âœ… Diet & Food Choices  
  âœ… Waste Management 
  âœ… Shopping & Consumer Habits  

# B. Statistical Analysis & Data Insights
- Identified high-impact activities contributing to the largest emissions.  
- Analyzed distribution of emissions across different user behaviors.  
- Compared emission levels based on different lifestyle choices.  

# C. Data Visualization
- Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to generate:  
  âœ… Histograms & bar charts to visualize emission distributions.  
  âœ… Heatmaps to show correlations between activities and emissions.  
  âœ… Pie charts for category-wise carbon footprint breakdown.

# 3. Dashboard Creation in Power BI  
- Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI for better data visualization.  
- Integrated key metrics and KPIs to track carbon footprint trends.  
- Created dynamic charts and graphs, including:  
  âœ… Line charts for emission trends over time.  
  âœ… Bar graphs comparing emissions across different categories.  
  âœ… Geo-maps to analyze regional variations in carbon footprints.  
  âœ… Filter and drill-down options** for deeper insights.

# 4. Key Insights from EDA & Dashboard 
ðŸ“Œ Travel & home energy use are the highest contributors to carbon emissions.  
ðŸ“Œ Meat-based diets result in significantly higher carbon footprints than plant-based diets.  
ðŸ“Œ Proper waste management can reduce overall emissions.  
ðŸ“Œ Users adopting public transport & energy-efficient appliances tend to have lower emissions.  

---  

# 5. Outcome of Phase 1  
âœ… Cleaned and structured dataset for further processing.  
âœ… Extracted meaningful patterns from user activities and carbon emissions.  
âœ… Developed interactive visualizations to enhance data-driven decision-making.  
âœ… Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time carbon footprint analysis.  
âœ… Prepared dataset for integration with the web-based tracker.
