1. Understanding Carbon Footprint and Its Impact

-Wiedmann & Minx (2008) define a carbon footprint as the total set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an    individual, organization, event, or product.
-According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), human activities contribute significantly to global warming, primarily through transportation, energy consumption, and waste management.
-Studies indicate that raising awareness about personal carbon footprints can lead to behavioral changes and sustainable choices.

2. Existing Carbon Footprint Tracking Methods
Traditional Approaches:

-Manual calculation using emission factor tables provided by environmental agencies.
-Government initiatives for corporate carbon reporting but limited tools for individuals.

Online Carbon Calculators:

-Many online tools (e.g., EPA Carbon Footprint Calculator, CoolClimate Network) provide rough estimates based on user inputs.
-These calculators often lack real-time tracking, personalized insights, and machine learning-based predictions.

Mobile and Web-based Applications:

-Apps like JouleBug, Capture, and Carbon Footprint Ltd. track emissions but are often region-specific and limited in scope.
-Most solutions focus on transportation and energy usage, neglecting dietary choices and consumer habits.

3. Research Gaps and Need for Improvement
-Lack of Personalized Analysis: Most tools provide generic estimates without considering individual lifestyle variations.
-Limited Data Visualization: Existing systems often lack interactive reports and trend analysis to help users understand their footprint.
-Absence of Real-Time Tracking: Many solutions do not allow users to track their emissions over time or compare historical data.
-Minimal Actionable Insights: While some calculators estimate emissions, they do not provide personalized recommendations for reducing footprints.

4. Proposed Solution and Innovation in Our Project
To address these gaps, our Carbon Footprint Tracker integrates:
✅ Real-time tracking using a user-friendly Streamlit-based web interface.
✅ Category-wise breakdown (transport, energy, diet, waste, shopping) for detailed analysis.
✅ Data visualization using graphs and interactive dashboards.
✅ Personalized recommendations for reducing emissions based on user activities.
✅ Machine learning-based insights (if extended in future phases) to predict and compare footprints over time.
