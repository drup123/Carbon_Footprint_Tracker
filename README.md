# Carbon_Footprint_Tracker
# **Abstract**  
Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, with carbon emissions being a major contributing factor. Many individuals remain unaware of their personal carbon footprint and how their daily activities—such as transportation, energy consumption, food choices, and waste management—impact the environment. This lack of awareness hinders efforts to adopt sustainable lifestyles.  

Our project, **"Carbon Footprint Detection,"** aims to bridge this gap by providing a web-based system that allows users to calculate and analyze their personal carbon emissions. Through data input, analysis, and visualization, users gain insights into their environmental impact and receive tailored recommendations to reduce their carbon footprint. This system empowers individuals to take meaningful steps toward sustainability, ultimately contributing to a healthier planet.
